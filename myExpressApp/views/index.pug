      h2 Overview
      p With our library management system, we plan to design an application that will ease users to access inventory at their local library. Users often do not want to spend the time to call or visit their local libraries to find materials, so with our application, we plan on creating an application that will allow them to locate materials from the comfort of their homes. We plan to implement an inventory of books and media at the local library.
