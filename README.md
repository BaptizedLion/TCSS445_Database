In order to run I would suggest copying the code link into VSCode. 
Or simply use VSCode to open the project folder.
Node.js and Express.js were used, i'm unsure if those need to be installed locally to work properly for grading purposes.
Need to change directory to myExpressApp. Then type 'npm start' in the node terminal. (However, this will only work if you have the local database schema).
Assuming the local database is also on your system. You would then go to your web browser and type 'http://localhost:3001/'.
